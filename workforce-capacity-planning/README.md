# HR Survey Analysis - Employee Satisfaction

**Case Study: People Analytics**

> **Executive Summary:**  
> The Seattle Department of Public Health required a data-driven approach to understand employee sentiment. This analysis utilized **Power Query** to normalize raw survey responses and visualize satisfaction drivers. The results revealed a critical **"Appreciation Gap"**—where employees reported high role clarity but low recognition—providing HR with a clear roadmap to improve retention through targeted recognition programs.

## Data Engineering & Analysis

### 1. Power Query Normalization

**Extracted raw survey responses from the Seattle Department of Public Health.**
Utilized Power Query to handle nulls, trailing spaces, and inconsistent survey categories, creating a clean dataset for comparative analysis.

### 2. Likert Scale Distribution Analysis

**Designed 100% stacked bar charts in Excel.**
Visualized the distribution of "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree" across 12+ survey parameters. This immediately surfaced the **"Appreciation Gap"**—where employees felt competent but unseen.

### 3. Sentiment Drivers

**Cross-referenced job clarity scores with support scores.**
The data proved that while operational clarity is high, the emotional connection to coworkers is a significant risk for long-term retention.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Retention Strategy

- **Deploy Recognition Programs:** Launch formal and informal programs to regularly acknowledge and celebrate employee contributions, directly addressing the feeling of being underappreciated.
- **Structured Team-Building:** Launch initiatives targeted at peer-to-peer connection to bridge the community gap.

### Operational Loop

- **Pulse-Check Surveys:** Implement regular pulses to track sentiment recovery in real-time.
- **Refine Onboarding:** Maintain high job-clarity scores by continuously refining the entry process.
