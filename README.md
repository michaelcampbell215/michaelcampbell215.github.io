## About Me

**Operations-First Analytics**

Most analysts start with a spreadsheet. I started on the **tarmac**.

I am an Operations Data Analyst with **10+ years of experience** in high-volume environments—from airline ground operations at **American Airlines** to inventory logistics at **Sonder**. I help logistics, supply chain, and operations teams identify inefficiencies that create cost, risk, or downtime using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Tableau**.

My background is built on operational discipline. I spent a decade managing time-critical ground operations where a 5-minute delay could cost thousands of dollars. Today, I combine that field experience with advanced data engineering skills to build automated reporting pipelines that replace manual guesswork with clear, actionable intelligence.
