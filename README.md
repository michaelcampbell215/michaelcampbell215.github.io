## About Me

I am an Operations Data Analyst with 10+ years of experience in high-volume environments—from airline ground operations to inventory logistics. I help logistics, supply chain, and operations teams identify inefficiencies that create cost, risk, or downtime using SQL, Python, and Tableau. I combine my field experience with advanced data engineering skills to build automated reporting pipelines that replace manual guesswork with clear, actionable intelligence. Based in Houston, TX, I am focused on helping operations teams work smarter, not harder.
